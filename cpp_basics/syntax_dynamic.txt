new data_type;
    it creates/stores space in dynamic/heap memory and 
    return the address of that memory.

int * a=new int;
    Here,
        new int ⇒ returns the address of the d-memory in which integer value is stored.
        a ⇒ pointer variable, stores the address of d-memory
    
    By dereferencing a, we can assign value to the dynamic variable 
    and print it and access it. 
    
    *a=10;          //assigning 10 by dereferencing the pointer of d-memory
    
    cout<<*a<<endl; //prints 10



Deleting Dynamic memory
    
    deleting a dynamic variable ⇒ delete pointer_variable;
    
    deleting a dynamic array ⇒ delete[] pointer_variable;
